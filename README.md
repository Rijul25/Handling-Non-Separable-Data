# Handling-Non-Separable-Data

We basically convert our 2D plot into a 3D plot for better visualisation

SVM and linear regreesion or logistic regression does not give a good accuracy on 2D non linearly separable data se we convert them into 3D and then check the accuracy

I am also attaching a .py file so feel free to run it from the command line to see the plots clearly.
